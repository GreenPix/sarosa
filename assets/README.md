## Information regarding the files present in that folder and sub folders.

Those assets are temporary and are not the property of Greenpix. They come
from the previous version of the game and can be found
[here](http://slayersonline.net/guide/listeskins0.html).
They're the property of their creator and only them can decide whether or not
you could use them.
For the duration of the development, they have been lent to GreenPix and thus
could be removed at any time.
